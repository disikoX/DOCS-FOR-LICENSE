The aim of this report is to demonstrate a meteorological measuring device, highlighting the problems it addresses and the solutions it offers. We'll start by introducing the concept of pressure, the different types of pressure, and its relationship with altitude.\\

After that, we'll establish the feasibility of the device, and propose its architecture in various diagrams. And we'll describe the methods used, the reasons for the choices made and applied in its design.\\

Finally, we will present the realization of the device, the different results obtained, and the different results obtained.
